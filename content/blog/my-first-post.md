# Hello World!

This is my **first blog post** written in markdown. Here are some features:

## Features I'm Testing

- Basic markdown rendering
- **Bold text**
- _Italic text_
- Code snippets

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello from my blog!');
}
```

## What's Next?

I plan to:

1. Add more styling
2. Implement syntax highlighting
3. Add a proper blog index
4. Set up canonical links to Dev.to

This is just the beginning!
